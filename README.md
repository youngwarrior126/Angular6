## Instructions and Navigations
The code for the book is organized around **checkpoints**. We have created multiple checkpoints that map to GitHub branches such as `checkpoint2.1`, `checkpoint2.2`, and so on. During the narration, we will highlight the branch for reference. These branches will contain the work done on the app up until that point in time.

The code will look like the following:
``` js
"styles": [
   "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css",
   "src/styles.css"
],
```
